iolang-syntax
=============

[Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/) syntax definition for the [Io language](iolanguage.org/).

Uses the [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) package.

---

Note that the syntax definitions are not complete. Currently supports:

* Strings (both single and tripple quoted)
* Numbers
* Comments
* A few "keywords"

What still needs to be done:

* More possible escape-sequences for single-quoted string
* More "keywords" and special messages
* Multiple (and better) categories for special messages
